# Computer Vision

The course addresses algorithms for automated computer vision. It focuses on building mathematical models of images and objects and using these to perform inference. Students will learn how to use these models to automatically find, segment and track objects in scenes, perform face recognition and build three-dimensional models from images.


## Content:

### More than one camera:
The fundamental and essential matrices. Sparse stereo methods. Rectification. Building 3D models. Shape from silhouette.

### Vision at a single pixel:
Background subtraction and colour segmentations problems. Parametric, non-parametric and semi-parametric techniques. Fitting models with hidden variables. 

### Connecting pixels:
Dynamic programming for stereo vision. Markov random fields. MCMC methods. Graph cuts.

### Texture:
Texture synthesis, super-resolution and denoising, image inpainting. The epitome of an image.

### Dense Object Recognition:
