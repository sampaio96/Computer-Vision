# Lab 1 - Fitting Probability Models

In this lab we will cover three different ways to fit probability distributions to data. We shall have a set of data points, X, for which we wish to learn the parameters for a given probability distribution. Here our data is one dimensional and continuous, so we shall focus on fitting a univariate normal distribution.

You will find three MATLAB files in which you should fill in the *TODOs* sections.

pract1_a.m
Here we will use maximum likelihood (ML) to find the parameters of the normal distribution which is most likely given the data.

pract1_b.m
In the second part of the lab we shall introduce some prior information about the parameters and find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) fit.

pract1_c.m
Finally, we shall cover parameter estimation from a Bayesian perspective.
